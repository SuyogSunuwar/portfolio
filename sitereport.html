    <h1>Site Report</h1>

    <p class="description">
        This page explains my experience of learning HTML, CSS, and GitHub.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This website was created as part of the CSY1063 Web Development module.
        The aim of this project was to design and develop a personal portfolio
        website using only HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website includes several pages such as Home, Projects, Contact,
        Site Report, and Video Demo. Throughout this assignment, I focused on
        keeping the design simple, clear, and easy to navigate.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
    <p>
        During this module, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML.
        I learned how to use headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists,
        and forms. I also learned how to connect multiple pages using navigation links.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also learned how to style web pages using CSS. This included changing
        fonts, colors, spacing, backgrounds, and layouts. Keeping all styles in
        one CSS file helped me manage the website more easily.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Choices</h2>
    <p>
        The design of the website is minimal and simple. I used a background image
        to make the website more visually appealing without making it too complex.
    </p>

    <p>
        The navigation bar is placed at the top of every page so users can easily
        move between pages. Each page uses a hero section with a different class
        name so the styling can be controlled from a single CSS file.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        One challenge I faced was keeping the layout consistent across all pages.
        I solved this by reusing the same navigation bar and footer on every page.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also found GitHub difficult at first, especially committing and pushing
        changes. With practice, I learned how to upload my files and track my
        progress properly.
    </p>

    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p>
        All HTML and CSS files were checked using online validation tools.
        Any errors found were fixed to make sure the code follows web standards.
        Screenshots of the validation results are included in the submission.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, this project helped me understand the basics of web
        development. I gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, and GitHub.
        This assignment improved my confidence in building simple websites.
